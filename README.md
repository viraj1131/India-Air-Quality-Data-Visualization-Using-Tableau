# India-Air-Quality-Data-Visualization-Using-Tableau

* In this project I am using Tablesu Dekstop for visualization and story telling on India Air Quality Data from kaggle.

### Objective:

* I have tried to do data stroy telling,Data visualization and Dashboarding using Tableau.My intent behind doing this visualization is to explore my visualization skills with tableau also help other by sharing my work which can help them to give ideas about visualization.

### Brief About Dataset:

* This data is combined (across the years and states) and largely clean version of the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP).

1. Stn_code (Dimension): Stores Particular Station Code for Sates or cities.
2. Sampling_Date (Dimension): Stores particular month and air quality report code.
3. State (Dimension): Stores Name of States.
4. Location (Dimension): Stores Name of Cities.
5. Agency (Dimension): Local Authority name which collected report.
6. So2 (Measure): Level of Sulphur dioxide.
7. No2 (Measure): Level of Nitrogen dioxide.
8. Rspm (Measure): Level of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter.
9. Spm (Measure): Level of Suspended Particulate Matter.
10. location_monitoring_station (Dimension): Place from Air quality measured.
11. pm2_5 (Dimension): Level between 2 and 5.
12. Date (Dimension): Stores dates monthly from Year 1987 to 2000.
13. Type (Dimension): Stores zone in which air quality measures like industrial, residential.

### Data Cleannig:

* Since dataset is ready to use it doesn't require any pre-processing before doing visualization although I have done some basic cleaning with dataset for example renaming column name Area to Area Type and correcting spelling of some cities and states and for doing this changes I have followed basic steps in Microsfot Excel.

### Basic Knowledge About Air Quality Measurements:

* (So2)-Sulfur dioxide,(No2)-Nitrogen dioxide Are One of Most Dengerous Outdoor Air Pollutants.Outdoor NO2 exposure may increase the risk of respiratory tract infections through the pollutant's interaction with the immune system.Sulfur dioxide (SO2) contributes to respiratory symptoms in both healthy patients and those with underlying pulmonary disease.

* Respirable Suspended particulate(RSPM) matters are produced from combustion processes, vehicles and industrial sources.
